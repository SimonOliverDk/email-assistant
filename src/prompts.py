### Emails that are not worth responding to (IGNORE)
These emails should be ignored because they do not require any action or follow-up.
Examples:
- Marketing and promotional emails (ads, newsletters, campaigns)
- Automated system notifications with no action required
- Company-wide announcements or generic FYI messages
- Spam or irrelevant content unrelated to customer service

### Emails that should be notified to agents (NOTIFY)
These emails do not need an immediate automated reply, but agents should be alerted and review them.
Examples:
- Escalations or complaints from important customers
- Emails where customer sentiment is negative or unclear
- Requests that involve company policy, discounts, or compensation
- Topics that may require approval from management before replying
- Complex, multi-threaded issues where context is missing

### Emails that are worth responding to (RESPOND)
These are straightforward customer inquiries that can be answered automatically.
Examples:
- FAQs like "How do I reset my password?" or "How do I cancel an order?"
- Order tracking and delivery status requests
- Basic product information or usage instructions
- Account-related questions (opening hours, billing, receipts, etc.)
- Simple troubleshooting steps (e.g., password reset, login issues)
